Saviine 0.1

Compatible with 5.3.2 fw

dumps WiiU Saves and is a mod of cafiine. Thanks to everyone who worked on cafiine!

Compilation :
- in order to compile cafiine you need to put the cafiine folder in your libwiiu project
- libwiiu/cafiine/installer must be compiled like the other libwiiu examples (with the build.py script)

Pre-made version :
- in www/saviine, it is already compiled, just put the folder in your server

Note :
- you can change the server ip directly in the application.
- start the saviine in folder with a short path, some savedata files have some really long names (170+ chracters)
- backup your savedata before dumping it!!! I'm not responsible for any lost data.

How to use :
- launch the kernel exploit in the brower
- open saviine server in your computer, check your ip
- relaunch browser and launch saviine app, set saviine server ip in the application with up/down/left/right, and press A to install saviine
  -> browser should exit
- launch a game or application
- the savedata should be dumped to a folder in /saviine/[title_id]
- profit
- you can close the game
