Saviine 0.2

Compatible with 5.3.2 fw

dumps WiiU Saves and is a mod of cafiine. Thanks to everyone who worked on cafiine!

Compilation :
- in order to compile saviine you need to put the saviine folder in your libwiiu project
- libwiiu/saviine/installer must be compiled like the other libwiiu examples (with the build.py script)

Pre-made version :
- in www/saviine, it is already compiled, just put the folder in your server

Note :
- you can change the server ip directly in the application.
- start the saviine in folder with a short path, some savedata files have some really long names (170+ chracters)
- backup your savedata before dumping it!!! I'm not responsible for any lost data.
- fastmode doesn't work for all games.

How to use :
Usage:
Normal mode: saviine_server.exe
Fast mode: saviine_server.exe fastmode

- launch the kernel exploit in the brower
- open saviine server in your computer, check your ip
(you can start the server in fastmode (faster dumper), this doesn't work for all games. Only use it when the savegame is really big (e.g. Super Smash Bros for WiiU) )
- relaunch browser and launch saviine app, set saviine server ip in the application with up/down/left/right, and press A to install saviine
  -> browser should exit
- launch a game or application
- the savedata should be dumped to a folder in /saviine/[title_id]
- profit
- you can close the game and dump an other
